# Project Description
This project is part of my Odin Project Journey. This is actually the
first project of this Course on Web Development to become a Fullstack
Software Engineer.
## What this Project aims
This project is supposed to be simple, and cover the initial steps with
HTMl and CSS. Through the Curriculum, these projects will become harder,
more impressive and much more real life applicable.

# How to view the pages on the web with Github
You can publish a website directly from a public Github Repo to the Web.
The site will be available under the URL that follows this pattern:
`your-github-username.github.io/your-github-repo-name`
## Step by Step on how to do so:
- The main HTML file should be index.html
- In the Github repo press `Settings`
- Click o `Pages`
- Select the Branch you want to use and save
- Wait some minutes (up to an hour if you are unlucky)
