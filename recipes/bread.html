		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>Fill the house with the aroma of freshly baked bread. From an easy white loaf to sourdough, focaccia
			and
			brioche, we have a range of sweet and savoury bread recipes.
		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>500g strong white flour</li>
			<li>2 tsp salt</li>
			<li>7g sachet fast-action yeast</li>
			<li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
			<li>300ml water</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Mix 500g strong white flour, 2 tsp salt and a 7g sachet of fast-action yeast in a large
				bowl.
			</li>
			<li>
				Make a well in the centre, then add 3 tbsp olive oil and 300ml water, and mix well. If
				the dough
				seems a little stiff, add another 1-2 tbsp water and mix well.
			</li>
			<li>
				Tip onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for around 10 mins.
			</li>
			<li>
				Once the dough is satin-smooth, place it in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with cling
				film.
				Leave to rise for 1 hour until doubled in size or place in the fridge overnight.
			</li>
			<li>
				Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Knock back the dough (punch the air out and
				pull the
				dough in on itself) then gently mould the dough into a ball.

			</li>
			<li>
				Place it on the baking parchment to prove for a further hour until doubled in size.
			</li>
			<li>
				Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7.
			</li>
			<li>
				Dust the loaf with some extra flour and cut a cross about 6cm long into the top of the
				loaf with
				a sharp knife.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bake for 25-30 mins until golden brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped
				underneath. Cool
				on a wire rack.
			</li>
		</ol>
